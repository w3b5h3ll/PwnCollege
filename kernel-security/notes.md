> The kernel is the core component of an operating system, serving as the bridge between software and hardware. Operating at the lowest level of the OS, the kernel's access is so profound that it can be likened to impersonating the system itself, surpassing even the highest privileges of a root user. Kernel security is paramount because a breach at this level allows attackers to act as if they are the system. Vulnerabilities can lead to scenarios like unauthorized data access, system crashes, or the silent installation of rootkits.
